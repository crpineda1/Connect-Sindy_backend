This is a cow-themed version of Connect Four that allows for two-player gameplay. Vanilla JavaScript is utilized
on the frontend to facilitate game logic, respond to user actions, and determine game outcomes. The backend is a RESTful API 
built with Ruby on Rails. The application is styled with custom CSS.

Please make sure to create the database and run the necessary migrations before starting the backend with the 'rails s' command in the terminal.
